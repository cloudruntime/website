The founders and early contributors of CloudRuntime have long experience in distributed application development, with in-depth knowledge of monoliths, SOA services, microservices, ServiceMesh, Dapr, etc., and have been working on the front line of production for a long time.

In terms of technical solutions and product forms, CloudRuntime is actively innovative and exploratory, adhering to a positive and pragmatic mindset, taking production landing as the basic starting point, meeting business needs as the guiding direction, and respecting reality.

We hope to build a practical lightweight distributed capacity solution with uncomplicated functions but sufficient to meet daily needs, excellent performance, low resource consumption, strong maintainability, and easy to learn and master.
